    "\n",
    "There are ${n \\choose k}$ possible\n",
    "samples of size $k$ from a population of size $n$.\n",
    "Imagine simply numbering them: taking a sample would require specifying only which of the samples to draw.\n",
    "\n",
    "This amounts to sending a 1-letter message in an ${n \\choose k}$-letter alphabet,\n",
    "where every 1-letter message has the same probability in the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shannon's coding theory implies that the most efficient way to encode such a message requires $\\log_2{n \\choose k}$ bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "A PRNG generates a message from its output bits.\n",
    "The period of the PRNG tells us the maximum number of messages the PRNG can generate starting from a particular seed.\n",
    "The period times the PRNG word length is the number of random bits that the PRNG can generate.\n",
    "(Not all the bits are \"equally random.\" For most PRNGs, the high-order bits behave more randomly than the low-order bits.)\n",
    "If this number is less than the number of bits per sample encoding times the number of samples, ${n \\choose k}\\log_2{n \\choose k}$, then it is not possible to generate all possible samples in one period of the PRNG, i.e., to list all the letters in the alphabet.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any particular PRNG period and word length (typically 32 bits), we can fix $k$ and calculate the largest $n$ for which the PRNG could possibly enumerate all possible samples.\n",
    "Similarly, we can fix $n$ and find the largest $k$ for which the PRNG can generate all possible samples.\n",
    "Only interesting for $1 \\leq k \\leq \\lfloor{\\frac{n}{2}}\\rfloor$.\n",
    "(For $k > \\lfloor{\\frac{n}{2}}\\rfloor$, think of sampling as selecting individuals to *exclude*.)\n",

    "+ Use a source of real randomness to set the seed with a substantial amount of entropy, e.g., 20 rolls of 10-sided dice.\n",
    "+ Record the seed so your analysis is reproducible.\n",
    "+ Use a PRNG at least as good as the Mersenne Twister, and preferably a cryptographic quality PRNG. Consider the PCG family. Avoid linear the usual congruential generators and the Wichmann-Hill generator.\n",
    "+ Use open-source software, and record the version of the software you use.\n",
    "+ Use a sampling algorithm that does not \"waste randomness.\" Avoid permuting the entire population.\n",

    "+ Avoid \"tests of representativeness\" and procedures that reject some samples. They alter the distribution of the sample."
